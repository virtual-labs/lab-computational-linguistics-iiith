  "introduction": "Introduction:</br>Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary study drawing inputs mainly from computer science and linguistics. Linguistics is the scientific study of human language. The subfields of linguistics include Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Discourse and Pragmatics. In computational linguistics, all these subfields are modeled computationally for analysis and generation of language. In the first phase of the virtual labs, however, learners are exposed to only two levels of language processing – word and sentence levels.</br></br>The experiments focus on part of speech tagging, shallow parsing and building of dictionaries. These experiments will help the learners from both the disciplines – linguistics and computer science – to have a hands on experience with language using computational methods.</br></br>For more details, visit <a href='https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/'>https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/</a>",
